    "Gaol of HUggingFace transformers libaray:    \n",
    "\n",
    "Its goal is to provide a **single API** through which any **Transformer model can be loaded, trained, and saved**.       \n",
    "The library‚Äôs main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Downloading, loading, and using a state-of-the-art NLP model for inference is made easy with just **two lines of code**.\n",
    "- The models are built using PyTorch nn.Module or TensorFlow tf.keras.Model classes, making them flexible and compatible with their respective ML frameworks.\n",
    "- The library emphasizes simplicity by **minimizing abstractions**.\n",
    "- The **\"All in one file\" concept** is central, where a model's forward pass is defined in a single file, ensuring code readability and modifiability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ü§ó Transformers has a very unique feature: unlike traditional ML libraries where models are constructed using shared modules across different files, in ü§ó Transformers, **each model has its own distinct layers**.       \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach offers several advantages:\n",
    " \n",
    "- Firstly, it makes the models more **accessible** and **comprehensible**, as the code for each model is self-contained and easier to understand. \n",
    "- Secondly, it provides the **flexibility to experiment** and **modify specific models without impacting others**. You can make changes to one model's layers or configurations without affecting the functionality or performance of other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting this approach, ü§ó Transformers enhances the **modularity**, ease of **experimentation**, and overall **usability** of the library."
